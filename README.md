# Fred's Demo

Mock-up for Fred's project

## How To Run / Use
- Do not use npm/yarn to run the project. I used it in dev for page refresh but the pages are static html/css.
- Do just open app/templates/index.html.

## Notes
- The gray Home Schedule Members ... buttons at the top are not part of the app, they are just to get from one mock-up to another.
- Mock-up buttons and other UI do nothing.
- It is battleship gray to make it look like a mock-up.
